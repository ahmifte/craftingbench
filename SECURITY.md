## User Responsibility Statement

By using CraftingBench, you acknowledge and agree that:

1. **You are solely responsible** for reviewing and testing all code generated by CraftingBench before using it in any environment
1. **You assume all risks** associated with executing any scripts or code generated by or included with CraftingBench
1. **You are responsible** for ensuring that any dependencies installed by CraftingBench templates meet your organization's security requirements

1. **You understand** that the maintainers make no guarantees about the security, reliability, or fitness for a particular purpose of this software

## Security Considerations for Users

CraftingBench is a tool that generates project templates and therefore has access to your filesystem. Here are some security considerations:

1. **Script Execution**: CraftingBench executes scripts to set up projects. ALWAYS review the templates before running them. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for verifying the safety of these scripts.

1. **Third-party Dependencies**: Templates may install third-party dependencies. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for the security implications of using these dependencies.

1. **GitHub Integration**: Some templates use GitHub CLI for repository creation. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for understanding and accepting the permissions you grant.

1. **Template Customization**: If you customize templates, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for following security best practices for the languages and frameworks you're using.

## Security Practices

The CraftingBench project attempts to follow these security practices:

1. **No Secret Storage**: CraftingBench isn't designed to store secrets or API keys within the tool itself.
1. **Minimal Dependencies**: We aim to minimize third-party dependencies to reduce the attack surface.
1. **Code Review**: Code changes undergo review before being merged into the main branch.
1. **Dependency Updates**: Dependabot is used to help keep dependencies up-to-date.

However, the maintainers make no guarantees about the effectiveness of these practices, and users should conduct their own security assessment.

## About Beta Status

CraftingBench v0.2.0 is currently in BETA. This means:

1. APIs and commands may change at any time without notice
1. Breaking changes may be introduced without warning
1. Code structure may evolve as the project matures
1. Security measures may be incomplete or ineffective
